# üëã Hi there


I am Victor Ferreira, a developer and technology student. I hold a degree in Information Security and work as a Front-end Developer at PersonalSoft. </br>

With 2 years of experience in the development market, I am constantly seeking to improve my skills with both front-end and back-end technologies, actively pursuing challenges to enhance my expertise.

# üöÄ Expertise

Initially, my specialization was focused on web development with an emphasis on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but currently, I am specializing in backend to better understand the entire application, as I find it very important to have the autonomy to solve certain problems.

My background is in Information Security, where I had a strong focus on vulnerability management and protection against attacks, and I was introduced to Python, which was the language I applied in the scientific article that served as my thesis. It was about quantum computing and cryptography.

In my free time, I enjoy studying, not only about technologies but also other subjects that I'm interested in.
